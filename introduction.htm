            <h3>What is Ruby?</h3>
            <p>Ruby is a popular programming language with many applications, one of its most common applications is for creating powerful websites using a framework(A base upon which developers build) called Ruby on Rails, however it can be used for pretty much anything. We chose Ruby for this guide as we believe it is a good introduction to programming making it easy for you to explore different programming paradigms within a single language, and having a straightforward and easy syntax.</p>

            <h3>About this guide</h3>
            <p>This guide is divided into chapters which you can see on the homepage. Each chapter consists of a number of lessons covering specific topics. Programming is a skill best learnt by doing it yourself so our lessons contain challenges for you to complete yourself, we have tried to use real world examples as far as possible so you can see practical uses of programming.</p>

            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>We are a group of students from UCL studying Computer Science, we hope we can help you to understand computer science and programming a bit better. Here is a short introduction to each of us:</p>

                <p>Hi,I  am a first year computer science undergraduate. I only started coding recently. I became interested in coding because of my interest in maths, analysis and problem solving. This project helped me to begin learning to programme in ruby. By creating some of the lessons for the project, I have been able to further my understanding of this language and also develop my communication and creative thinking skills.</p>
                <h4>Alex</h4>
                <img></img>
                <p>Greetings, I study Computer Science at UCL, my name is Alex and I enjoy programming. I have experimented with programming for years although my study has become more concentrated in the University environment.</p>
                <h4>Nathan</h4>
                <img></img>
                <p>Hey, I’m am currently doing a bachelors of science in computer science. I have been programming for roughly a year with a strong background in mathematics and computational biology. I enjoy app development and cryptanalysis in my free time.</p>
                <h4>Kalingen</h4>
                <img></img>
                <p>I am currently in my first year of studying computer science. I entered the undergraduate course due to an interest in maths and the realisation that I enjoyed programming as well through a general studies course in school.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>A browser</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That is really all you will need we have set up this guide so that you can program on the web pages in code boxes, however if you later want to go further beyond this guide you are best off getting Ruby from <a href="https://ruby-lang.org">here</a>.</p>
