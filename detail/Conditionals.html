<title>Unit 3: Conditionals</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>If statements</h1>
<p>If statements are used to make sure that the program only does something if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><b>a = 6 </b> </p>
<p><b>b = 5 </b> </p>
<p><b>if a + b == 11 </b> </p>
<p><b>puts “Hello Spaceman” </b></p>
<p>end</p>
<p> Since a + b = 5 + 6 = 11, “Hello Spaceman” will be printed to the console on a new line. The “end” is just there to highlight the end of the if clause</p>
<p>You may be wondering why two equals signs were used for the if statement. This means that the program is comparing the two values. In this instance it is comparing the result of a + b against 11. </p>
<p>There are several other “comparators” which can be used in Ruby:</p>
<ul>
 <li> == (Check if the values either side are equivalent) </li>
 <li> != (Check if the values either side are unequal) </li>
 <li> <  (Check if the value on the left is strictly less than the value on the right)
 <li> <= (Check if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right) </li>
 <li> >  (Check if the value on the left is strictly greater than the value on the right)
 <li> >= (Check if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right) </li>
</ul>
<p>We can also provide alternate options for the program if the initial condition isn’t met using the <b>else</b> or <b>elseif</b> functions.</p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p><b>x = 5</b></p>
<p><b>if x == 5 </b></p>
<p><b>   puts "This is great!"</b></p>
<p><b>elseif x <= 4 </b></p>
<p><b>   puts "Nope, there's no Spaceman to say hello to!"</b></p>
<p><b>elseif x >= 6 </b></p>
<p><b>   puts "There are too many Spacemen, something has gone wrong!"</b></p>
<p> end </p>
<p>Here, since x is 5, the output will be "This is great!". If the value of x is edited to something less than 5, then, due to the  </p>
<h2>Unless Statements</h2>
<p>Unless statements are the opposites of if statements where the function will be perfomed <b>unless</b> the condition is fulfilled.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><b>j = 3</b></p>
<p><b>unless j = 15</b></p>
<p><b>   puts "j is not 15"</b></p>
<p> end </p>
<p>We have stated that j has a value of 3. The unless statment's condition is such that "j is not 15" will be outputted so long as (shockingly) j is not 15.</p>
<h3>Logical Operators</h3>
<p>Logical operators are used in conditional statements where two conditions need to be satisfied, for example if value <b>a</b> needs to be greater than 3, but value <b>b</b> must be 5 exactly</p>
<p>There are several logical operators in Ruby:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &&  (Logical AND operator: both conditions must be satisfied )</li>
  <li> and (same as &&)</li>
  <li> ||  (Logical OR operator: at least one of the conditions must be satisfied)</li>
  <li> or  (same as ||)</li>
  <li> !   (reverses the logic of the statement so that it's false when true and true when false)</li>
  <li> not (same as !)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example</p>
