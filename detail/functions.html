            <h1>Functions</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Functions allow a section of code to be encapsulated so that it can be used multiple times to avoid duplication of code and make the code easier to read</p>
            <p>To define a function 'def' is used followed by the function name and then the code that follows is the function until an 'end' statement that is not closing a block within the function.</p>
            <!-- Example of function definition -->
            <p>A function can take parameters, which allows it to be given values when it is used, by including names for the parameters in brackets after its name separated by commas.</p>
            <p>Functions either return a value or cause side-effects. So for example you could have a function that adds two numbers and then you could make that return the result of the addition, this can be done explicitly using a 'return' statement or otherwise the last statement in the code will be evaluated as what will be returned. A function otherwise could cause side-effects such as a drawLine function could draw a line in a graphical environment, but would have no meaningful return value</p>
            <!-- Example -->
            <p>Normally when using functions the code of the function is indented as shown in these examples so that it is easier to read. As well as this if a function is returning a boolean value its name is normally ended with a '?' to indicate this to make it easier to make sure the functions are being used correctly by indicating return type in the name.</p>
            <!-- Example -->
            <p>Functions are called by just typing their name, and if they take parameters they are included in brackets separated by commas.</p>
